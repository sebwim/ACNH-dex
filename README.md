# ACNH-dex
An Animal Crossing: New Horizons Villager Dex to track which villagers you have met on your journey.


To-Do:
- Add images in the table for all villagers = DONE
- Sort the table alphabetically = DONE
- Add a button to hide/unhide seen villagers = DONE
- Update the search to be able to search by personality and species as well as name
- Make the site look a little nicer
- Add more information about villagers (birthday, initial catchphrase)
- Add checkboxes in the table for: Villager in town, seen on campsite, received picture.
- Find a better Search icon
- Filters: Show/Hide Personality, Show/Hide species

Bugs:
- If villagers are hidden using the "Hide checked" button, then the alternating background colours for the rows gets messed up
